    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Coffee is the fruit or berry of an evergreen tree. The two main types are the Arabica and the Robusta. Arabica is the quality sort. Hand picked when ripe the bean is separated from the berry and then dried (or washed) and graded. The green bean keeps almost indefinitely and it is only on roasting that its wonderful aromas and flavours are released. Variations in colour, flavour and aroma develop according to the degree of the Roa</p>
